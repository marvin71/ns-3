/**
 * A challenge with SimBricks adapter initialization is that it conceptually
 * requires multiple adapters to be initialized asynchronously to avoid any
 * deadlocks. Each adapter has to wait for a ux socket connection to be
 * accepted or an outgoing connection established, then send and wait for the
 * received intro message.
 * To avoid deadlocks in the full simbricks simulation, we use non-blocking I/O
 * and do initialization in two phases. First create all adapters and register
 * them with the init manager. Then in the "startup phase" after all adapters
 * are registered, we can then process I/O events across all of them and wait
 * for initialization to complete, while also completing other I/O events as
 * needed.
